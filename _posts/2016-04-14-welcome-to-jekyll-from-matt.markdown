Hey there, Matt here! I see you've stumbled along to our awesome website! Here are a few basics on how this works.

### Want an full guide on how to post a blog post? Visit [here](/shadblog/contribute)!

Posts are found in the `_posts` directory. Each post has a YAML header, that looks like this:

```

The only things you need to edit there are the title, date, and categories: for now, it's not too big of a deal of what you put there (though everything is self-explanatory), but it'll come important when we start publishing.

After that, you just put in markdown (.markdown)! If you're not familiar with Markdown, you can find a pretty awesome guide [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

In order to run our site, you'll need to have jekyll installed on your computer. That's a long ordeal, and I'm not going to lie I'm not particularly well-versed in explaining it to you. Instead, you can visit [this site](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home) to see how it works, if you do fancy giving it a try (hint hint, you need to run `gem install jekyll`, followed by `jekyll serve` in the directory you've cloned our repository).

Speaking of repository, you can find our repository [here](http://github.com/malsf21/blogs-test), where all of our code is stored (and where you can contribute)! You can also find our website with the latest stable code [here](http://matthewwang.me/shadblog).

Check out the [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home) for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. If you have any questions, feel free to ping me a message on [twitter](http://twitter.com/malsf21), or [github](http://github.com/malsf21).

Happy Blogging!
